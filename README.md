### Welcome, Padawan! 🔧

<h2> About me 👔 </h2>

<p> I'm a Software Engineering student at UFRN, I'm also a Dev Front-End Intern at Justiça Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (JFRN).
  I have been studying programming for the last two and a half years, and can say for sure I'm fascinated by Web Developmen, and
  looking up to learn more about the Back-End and become a full stack developer.
