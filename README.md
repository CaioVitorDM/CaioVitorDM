### ðŸ”§ Welcome, Padawan, I'm Caio!


<h3 style="align: left"> About me ðŸ‘” </h3>

<p> I'm a Software Engineering student at UFRN, I'm also a Dev Front-End Intern at JustiÃ§a Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (JFRN).
  I have been studying programming for the last two and a half years, and can say for sure I'm fascinated by Web Developmen, and
  looking up to learn more about the Back-End and become a full stack developer.
